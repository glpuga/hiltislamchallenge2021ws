  #      fy = P1[1][1] or P2[1][1], cy = P1[1][2] or P2[1][2]

  # Stereo Rectification #
  #======================#

  # original intrinsic parameters (K, D) and stereo-recitification parameters (R)
  # matrices (K, R) are written in row-major order

  # The camera setup is such that the left camera is camera 1 and the right one camera 0
